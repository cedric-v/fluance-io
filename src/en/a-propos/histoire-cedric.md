        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
          From a very young age, Cédric felt out of step with the rigid framework of traditional school. Rather frail by nature, he instinctively sought a way to preserve his physical integrity and assert himself. It was in martial arts that he found this refuge, but he discovered much more than a simple method of defense. Beyond movement, it was the depth of practice that captivated him, leading him very early to initiate himself into seated Zen meditation (zazen). A seed of spirituality and inner search was then planted.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#82153e]">2. The call of the open road and transformation</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
          After training in computer science that allowed him to structure his thoughts and finance his dreams, Cédric decided to leave everything to answer the call of Asia. Backpack on his back, he left for an entire year on the roads, embracing a life of radical letting go. From the Wudang mountains in China for Tai-Chi to the lands of Kerala in India for Yoga, through meditation in Dharamsala to the Gobi desert, he fed on each experience and the beauty of vast spaces. He returned from this initiatory journey transformed and with three certainties for his future: marry the one who shared this adventure, start a family and create his own activity.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
          The return is synonymous with rare intensity. Cédric leads everything at once: marriage, the arrival of two children, building his house and maintaining a salaried job. In parallel, driven by fierce will, he builds his independence. The path is long: after two years of training and four years of experimentation and business model adjustments, his perseverance pays off. He finally manages to create a solid and viable activity in French-speaking Switzerland, realizing the vision he had during his journey.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
          Yet, professional success does not quench his thirst for the absolute. Driven by the desire to contribute even more, Cédric insidiously falls into the trap of escalation. He complicates his activity, adding layers that, instead of elevating him, end up weighing him down. This race to "always more" creates an imbalance and generates palpable family tensions. It's this alarm signal that makes him realize he has moved away from the essential and that he must absolutely find another way so as not to lose everything.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
          It's in simplicity that Cédric finally finds his answer. He decides to deconstruct what is superfluous to return to the very essence of his action: fluidity. By radically simplifying his processes and approach, he not only regains family harmony, but also discovers unprecedented power of action. It's from this journey, made of climbs, detours and returns to the essential, that Fluance's philosophy was born: moving forward with clarity, without forcing, where movement is most just.
